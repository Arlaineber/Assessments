## ASSESSMENT TASK 4: Communicate changes

**Once you have downloaded the assessment document "Template Task 4_ Communicate changes" from Other Resources, follow the instructions to complete the activities listed below.**

**Activity 4.1** After the meeting, you are required to provide feedback to management about the revised outline of your team project. Using Template 4.1 based on your discussion with the team members, produce a revised project brief with a general timeline showing the extension of the project. In your brief, identify when the three (3) components (software, hardware, and networking) will each be ready for installation, with a brief explanation of the reason for the delay.

### Template 4.1

Revised team goals for the project

_Key points: Students must write the revised team goals for procuring software, hardware and network_

_Benchmark answer: There has been a delay in receiving the required hardware from the supplier, and as a result, the project has been extended by an additional 2 (3) weeks to account for receiving the equipment and installing it on the site._

Revised timeline for the project (for each: software, hardware and networking) with a brief explanation of the reason for the delay

_Key points: The student must provide the revised timeline for each, i.e., software, hardware and networking. The response should be similar to the below:_

- _Hardware procurement is delayed by two weeks due to a delay in the planning and evaluation process_
- _Networking equipment will be installed on time and on schedule_
- _The software has been acquired and will be installed when the hardware is ready_
- _Testing of the equipment will also be delayed as per the hardware availability_

**Activity 4.2** Assume that the project is now complete. You have received the following feedback from your team members:

- _Dale did not feel heard in the team meeting._
- _The team members believed that the tasks were not evenly distributed. The project could have been completed in a shorter timeframe if the tasks were divided equally or shared amongst the team members._

Based on the above feedback and using Template 4.2, list two (2) skills that you need to build to improve personal performance and behaviour while working in a team.

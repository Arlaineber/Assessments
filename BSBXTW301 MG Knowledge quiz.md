SkillageIT Organisational Values – this document sets out some key points that would be part of a teamwork policy document, such as the importance of people, ownership, integrity and trust. All these areas are important for teamwork.

Upskilled SkillsTalk – emphasises the success of organisations that prioritise teamwork and collaboration. Points raised include considering multiple solutions so that teams are able to achieve results at a more efficient rate; engaging employees to foster better and clearer communication, higher morale and greater productivity; professional growth; and encouraging effective positive risk-taking.

Question 5. In your own words, describe three (3) techniques that can be used to:
a) give constructive feedback to team members. 
b) receive constructive feedback from team members. (75-150 words total) 
Key points: Description of 3 techniques that can be used to give and receive constructive feedback to team members. If the information is sourced from somewhere else, the source must be mentioned.

Example answers: Three required – other responses can be accepted if they are applicable.
Give feedback constructively - Three required – other responses can be accepted if they are applicable
? Establish trust: Always follow the review, reporting, and investigation processes and maintain confidentiality. A willingness to listen to and respond to a team member’s concerns and engage in genuine, sincere dialogue will help build respect and trust.
? Balance the positive and the negative feedback: Balanced feedback reduces the risk of de-motivating a team member when they are receiving negative feedback that they may find challenging. It is important to recognise positive as well as negative performance whilst also ensuring that constructive feedback messages are understood and acted on. Do not mislead; however, offer positive points so the team member remains motivated.
? Observe reactions: Be prepared for different reactions, including emotional responses that can include shock, denial, anger, worry, confusion or relief, acceptance, and happiness. Always stay calm and professional, focusing on options for doing things differently and agreeing on possible solutions. 
? Be specific: Always focus on specific observable facts when describing the person’s actions and performance. Be specific about what has been done well and what needs to be improved in terms of meeting timeframes, using technology, or collaborating with colleagues, for example. The more specific the feedback is, the more useful it will be for the team member. 
? Talk face-to-face: Constructive criticism should, whenever possible, take place in person, either in a virtual 1:1 meeting or at a physical location. Body language and subtle nuances are not conveyed in a phone call or an email which can lead to messages being misinterpreted and misunderstood. Meeting face-to-face gives both people more of a chance to understand exactly what the other is saying.
? Don’t make it personal: Being personal will lead the recipient of the feedback to shut down. They will be less likely to act on or learn from the points you are making.
? Provide feedback consistently: Regular feedback meetings will help avoid lengthy, negative, and unexpected feedback. The feedback recipient should not be surprised by the points you are making. 
? Be timely: Don’t store feedback. Give feedback as soon as possible and practical (within 24 hours of a specific event or instance if you can). Keeping people regularly updated on how you see their progress helps to establish trust and encourages effective team working.

Receiving feedback: Three required – other responses can be accepted if they are applicable.
? Don’t take it personally. Feedback is provided to help you learn and develop.
? Listen and ask questions if uncertain.
? There should be no surprises. If something is discussed that was not previously mentioned, you can request time to consider the new item.
? Be positive with body language and communication.
? If issues are raised, there should also be opportunities to address these. If not, request them.
? Keep focused, and don’t get drawn into a discussion about other areas.
? Take notes.
Question 6. With the ongoing challenges to teams through events such as COVID, in your own words, describe three (3) methods to support team members. (70-100 words total)
Key points: 3 methods to support team members. If the information is sourced from somewhere else, the source must be mentioned.
Example answers: Developed from the learning material. Alternative answers can be accepted if they are applicable.
? Addressing conflicting interests to ensure that team goals and objectives are achieved. For example, if a team member is off sick, complete some of the work they would do.
? Addressing incompatible work styles. Some team members may prefer oral communication, while others may communicate through email. You need to acknowledge and accept the different styles and work with the team members, not against them.
? Addressing the failure to follow norms. COVID introduced a range of new issues and business practices. What was the norm previously that may have changed? As a team member, you need to accept that there will be times when the normal way of doing things has changed. Being receptive and supportive of these changes is important for the team.
? Addressing poor communication. Sometimes we communicate in a short statement that is to the point but may not consider the other person to whom it is addressed. Being aware of the communication style and language used in communicating with others is important to support others. 
? Addressing performance deficiencies. Where a staff member is not performing, a conversation with them may identify a lack of knowledge, training, etc., which can then be provided to overcome the deficiency.
? Sometimes we may not work at our normal performance due to illness or other reasons. Making other team members aware of this will allow them to support you. When others are in a similar situation, the support previously provided can be returned.    
Question 7. In your own words, describe three (3) key principles of cross-cultural communication. (150-250 words total)
Key points: The three (3) key principles of cross-cultural communication. If the content is sourced from somewhere else, the source must be mentioned.

Example answers: Developed from the learning material. Alternative answers can be accepted if they are applicable.
? Maintain etiquette: Many cultures have specific etiquette around the way they communicate. Before you meet, research the target culture, or if time allows, do some cross-cultural training. For example, many cultures expect a degree of formality at the beginning of communication between individuals. Every culture has its specific way of indicating this formality: ‘Herr’ and ‘Frau’ in Germany, reversing family and given names in China and the use of ‘san’ in Japan for men and women etc. 
? Avoid slang: Not even the most educated non-native English speaker will have a comprehensive understanding of English slang, idioms and sayings. They may understand the individual words you have said but not the context or the meaning. As a result, you could end up confusing them or, at worst, offending them.
? Speak slowly: Even if English is the common language in a cross-cultural situation, it’s not a good idea to speak at your normal conversational speed. Modulating your pace will help, as will speaking clearly and pronouncing your words properly. Break your sentences into short, definable sections and give your listener time to translate and digest your words as you go. 
? Keep it simple: In a cross-cultural conversation, there’s no need to make it harder for both of you by using big words. Just keep it simple. Two-syllable words are much easier to understand than three-syllable words, and one-syllable words are better than two-syllable words. Say, “Please do this quickly”, rather than, ”Please do this in an efficacious manner.”
? Practice active listening: Active listening is a very effective strategy for improving cross-cultural communication. Restate or summarise what the other person has said to ensure that you have understood them correctly, and ask frequent questions. This helps build rapport and ensures that important information doesn’t get missed or misunderstood.
? Take turns to talk: Make the conversation flow more freely by taking turns to speak. Make a point, and then listen to the other person respond. Particularly when people are speaking English as their second language, it’s better to talk to them in short exchanges rather than delivering a long monologue that might be difficult for them to follow.
Question 8. In your own words, describe three (3) key principles that must be followed while communicating with individuals with special needs or disabilities. (50-80 words total)
Key points: Three (3) key principles that must be followed while communicating with individuals with special needs or disabilities. If the content is sourced from somewhere else, the source must be mentioned.

Example answers: Developed from the learning material. Alternative answers can be accepted if they are applicable.
? Speak to a person with a disability as you would speak to anyone else. Speak in an age-appropriate tone and treat adults as adults.
? If a person with a disability is accompanied by another person, such as a carer, you should still speak directly to the person with a disability.
? Put the person first, not their disability. For example, use the term a ‘person with a disability rather than a ‘disabled person’.
? Try to avoid negative phrases such as ‘suffers from’ and ‘crippled’. Use the phrase ‘people who use a wheelchair’ rather than ‘wheelchair bound’.
? Use accessible language.
? Avoid jargon or long words that might be hard to understand. Use simple and clear words.
? Be prepared to use different communication tools that the other person is comfortable using.
? Follow the lead of the person you’re communicating with and wait patiently for their response.
? Go at the pace of the person you’re communicating with, check you have been understood, and be creative in addressing issues.
Question 9: In your own words, describe the following methods for remote work, and list two (2) currently used tools (e.g. applications) for each method. (100-150 words total)
? Phone or mobile
? Video conferencing
? Remote desktop applications

Key points: description and two (2) tools relevant to the following:
? Phone or mobile
? Video conferencing
? Remote desktop applications
If the content is sourced from somewhere else, the source must be mentioned.

Example answers: Developed from the learning material. Alternative answers can be accepted if they are applicable.
MethodDescriptionRelated toolsPhone or mobileThe best way to create a remote office phone system is to start with a quality VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) phone system. VoIP phone systems provide users with functionality that was once reserved for advanced call centres. These features are now standard for most modern office phone systems.Skype, WhatsAppVideo conferencing appsVideo calls can make you feel like you’re in the same room with your virtual teammates, and seeing others’ expressions and gestures and hearing their voices go a long way in having more effective conversations.Zoom, MS TeamsRemote desktop appsRemote desktop apps securely connect you to a computer at another location, so you can work on it as if you’re sitting in front of that computer’s keyboard.TeamViewer, GoToMyPCQuestion 10: In your own words, describe three (3) remote work issues or challenges that may impact team performance and outcomes. (150-200 words total)
Key points: three (3) remote work challenges that may impact team performance and outcomes. If the content is sourced from somewhere else, the source must be mentioned.

Example answers: Developed from the learning material. Alternative answers can be accepted if they are applicable.
? Technical failure: You don’t have to worry about technical hiccups at your workplace, as you’ll have an IT team in person helping you resolve all your issues. However, working from home or remotely will require you to be prepared to fix things yourself most of the time. Moreover, if you’re not tech-savvy, you could find yourself at a struggle even more during such situations.
? Poor communication: One of the major challenges associated with remote work is communication. Lack of in-person interaction can lead to miscommunication and make you feel disconnected from your team. Hence, communicating effectively with your team becomes necessary to get your message across. It will help you avoid any confusion as well as delays in accomplishing your tasks.
? Working across different time zones: A remote career will open up many opportunities for you to engage with a global team. Working with a global team helps you explore cultural diversities, share ideas, and have a wealth of learning experiences. However, collaborating could be challenging as you and your team will be working across different time zones
? Productivity issues: While working remotely can be liberating, you’re most likely to face productivity issues if you’re not used to working without supervision or someone around. It’s normal for experienced remote workers as well to face such challenges over time. Productivity issues can result in failing to plan your tasks during the day, time management issues, difficulty managing your work/life balance, and more.
? Distractions: When working from home, you can easily get distracted by the smallest thing around you, like your phone, social media, or even the constant urge to move around. This can make you procrastinate and keep you from achieving your goals.Question 11: In your own words, describe three (3) techniques to ensure effective team collaboration in a remote environment. (30- 60 words total)
Key points:  three (3) techniques to ensure effective team collaboration in a remote environment. If the content is sourced from somewhere else, the source must be mentioned.

Example answers: Developed from the learning material. Alternative answers can be accepted if they are applicable.
? Prepare for technical failures and backup important organisational data using secure backup and restore tools
? Prepare to deal with possible technical failures
? Follow the rules surrounding the frequency of online communication in the form of 1:1 and team meetings. The best practice is to aim for over-communication (multiple meetings in a week) when collaborating in a virtual workplace environment
? Participate in training in the application of appropriate platform security and privacy settings
? Participate in training regarding professional standards expected in all media communication
? Address your concerns, remote work challenges, skill requirements and communication conflicts
? Use only the platforms that are authorised by the organisation
? Do not use personal email or social media accounts for workplace collaboration
? Make use of system-level controls to control access to platform features and functions. Use the content filters and privacy settings for security
? Follow the boundaries regarding the use of collaboration tools during workplace hours only
? Follow the boundaries regarding rules surrounding when to use each communication channel (e.g., based on the style, immediacy, and formality of each channel)
? Follow the boundaries regarding a default time zone
? Follow the boundaries regarding online meeting etiquette rules, such as:
? Muting of microphones when not talking
? Video cameras on (with the option to turn off cameras when the meeting is being recorded)
? Raise your hand to ask a question
